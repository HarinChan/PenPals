OpenVINO crash notes (Intel MacBook Pro 2018)

Observed issue
- Intermittent segmentation faults after repeated prompts.
- Native crash in OpenVINO runtime (process exit 139).

Likely cause
- OpenVINO and/or OpenVINO GenAI native runtime instability on older Intel Macs
  under sustained load. This is outside Python exception handling.

Possible fixes / mitigations
- Reduce model load:
  - Use a smaller model or lower max_new_tokens.
  - Keep temperature modest (e.g., 0.7) to reduce compute variance.
- Limit parallelism to reduce native thread pressure:
  - Set OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
  - Set OV_NUM_STREAMS=1
- Ensure latest compatible OpenVINO + OpenVINO GenAI packages are installed.
- Run inference in a separate worker process and auto-restart on crash.
- Prefer INT4/INT8 quantized models for lower memory pressure.
